    "Kernels are the execution engines which execute programming languages such as **Ju**lia, **Py**thon or **R** (hence Jupyter). Today many other languages are also supported by Jupyter.  We will only be dealing with Python kernels in this course. The Python kernel is based on IPython, which is the modern Python REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) interpreter.  You can run IPython from a shell command line if you like and get much of the same functionality as a Notebook with a Python kernel."
